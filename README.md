# Aviation Supply Chain Risk – Showcase Repo

This repository is a **curated showcase** of my MSc research work on **supply chain risk in the aviation sector**, integrating:

- 📊 **Supply Chain Stress Index (SCSI)** – PCA-based index from trade and macroeconomic indicators  
- 🧮 **Bayesian Time-Varying Parameter VaR (TVP-VaR)** – probabilistic modeling under data constraints  
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Forecasting** – Multi-Resolution Temporal Fusion Transformer (MR-TFT)  
- 📝 **LLM-based Trade Data Extraction** – hybrid regex + LLM pipeline for structured statistics  

⚠️ **Note:** This is a **showcase version** of my thesis repo. It uses **synthetic/sample data** for demonstration. Full datasets and raw thesis code are kept private.
